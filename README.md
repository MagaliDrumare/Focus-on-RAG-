- DBRX: A New State-of-the-Art Open LLM created by Databricks
DBRX provides the open community and enterprises building their own LLMs with capabilities that were previously limited to closed model APIs; according to our measurements, it surpasses GPT-3.5, and it is competitive with Gemini 1.0 Pro. It is an especially capable code model, surpassing specialized models like CodeLLaMA-70B

## 🎯 Focus on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Introduction au RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Trouver un équilibre entre l’exploitation des capacités du langage LLM et le respect de la confidentialité et de la sécurité des données d’entreprise est donc primordial pour une intégration réussie. Et c’est souvent ici qu’intervient le RAG !

### Premiers pas vers un RAG en augmentant un LLM avec un fichier pdf (en 5 mins chrono)
Dans cet article nous n’allons pas faire du fine tuning de notre LLM. A la place nous allons utiliser la technique de détection de similarité qui va s’appuyer sur des données extérieures au LLM. D’où le titre de cet article qui indique que nous allons nous lancer progressivement vers le RAG (RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Car c’est finalement ça le RAG: un moyen de mieux contextualiser un LLM avec des données pour lesquelles il n’a pas été entrainé.

### RAG Gradio app with Mistral AI 
The level of abstraction and complexity you can achieve in coding today, provided you know how to leverage the right tools, is amazing! 🚀 
With  <30 lines of code, I've created a basic RAG app capable of performing Q&A on any PDF by leveraging Gradio, LlamaIndex, and Mistral AI

### How Einstein Copilot Search Uses Retrieval Augmented Generation to Make AI More Trusted and Relevant
At World Tour NYC, Salesforce introduced new unstructured data capabilities for Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot Search. By bringing together data retrieval capabilities using semantic search and prompts in Einstein Copilot, responses by Large Language Models (LLMs) will be more accurate, up-to-date, and generated with more transparency — while also keeping company data safe and secure through the Einstein Trust Layer.
