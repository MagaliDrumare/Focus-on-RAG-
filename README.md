## ðŸŽ¯ Focus on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Introduction au RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Trouver un Ã©quilibre entre lâ€™exploitation des capacitÃ©s du langage LLM et le respect de la confidentialitÃ© et de la sÃ©curitÃ© des donnÃ©es dâ€™entreprise est donc primordial pour une intÃ©gration rÃ©ussie. Et câ€™est souvent ici quâ€™intervient le RAG !

### Premiers pas vers un RAG en augmentant un LLM avec un fichier pdf (en 5 mins chrono)
Dans cet article nous nâ€™allons pas faire du fine tuning de notre LLM. A la place nous allons utiliser la technique de dÃ©tection de similaritÃ© qui va sâ€™appuyer sur des donnÃ©es extÃ©rieures au LLM. Dâ€™oÃ¹ le titre de cet article qui indique que nous allons nous lancer progressivement vers le RAG (RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Car câ€™est finalement Ã§a le RAG: un moyen de mieux contextualiser un LLM avec des donnÃ©es pour lesquelles il nâ€™a pas Ã©tÃ© entrainÃ©.
